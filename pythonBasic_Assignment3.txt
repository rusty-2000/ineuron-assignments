1.Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.

2.The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.

3.The def statement defines (that is, creates) a function.

4.A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.

A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function's return value.

5.There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called

6.When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.

7.A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.

8.If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.

9.A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.

10.The data type of None is NoneType.
