1. The mean sales for Region A is 12.6 and the mean sales for Region B is 19.

2. The mode of the survey responses is 4.

3. The median salary for Department A is 5500 and the median salary for Department B is 5200.

4. The range of the stock prices is 2.3, which is the difference between the highest price (26.1) and the lowest price (23.8).

5. The t-test results show that there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups (p-value < 0.05). The mean score for Group A is 87.5 and the mean score for Group B is 85.

6. The correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales is 0.75. This means that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables.

7. The standard deviation of the heights is 5.1.

8. The linear regression results show that employee tenure is a significant predictor of job satisfaction (p-value < 0.05). The slope of the regression line is 1.2, which means that for every additional year of employee tenure, the job satisfaction score increases by 1.2 points.

9. The ANOVA results show that there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between the two medications (p-value < 0.05). The mean recovery time for Medication A is 12 and the mean recovery time for Medication B is 15.

10. The 75th percentile of the feedback ratings is 8.

11. The hypothesis test results show that there is no significant difference between the mean weight and 10 grams (p-value > 0.05).

12. The chi-square test results show that there is a significant difference in the click-through rates between the two designs (p-value < 0.05). Design A has a higher click-through rate than Design B.

13. The 95% confidence interval for the population mean satisfaction score is 7.1 to 8.9.

14. The simple linear regression results show that temperature is a significant predictor of performance (p-value < 0.05). The slope of the regression line is 0.5, which means that for every additional degree Celsius, the performance score increases by 0.5 points.

15. The Mann-Whitney U test results show that there is a significant difference in the median preferences between the two groups (p-value < 0.05). Group A has a higher median preference than Group B.

16. The interquartile range (IQR) of the ages is 15, which is the difference between the 75th percentile (55) and the 25th percentile (40).

17. The Kruskal-Wallis test results show that there is a significant difference in the median accuracy scores between the algorithms (p-value < 0.05). Algorithm C has the highest median accuracy score.

18. The simple linear regression results show that price is a significant predictor of sales (p-value < 0.05). The slope of the regression line is 1.5, which means that for every additional dollar in price, sales increase by 1.5 units.

19. The standard error of the mean satisfaction score is 0.3.

20. The multiple regression results show that advertising expenditure is a significant predictor of sales (p-value < 0.05). The coefficient for advertising expenditure is 1.2, which means that for every additional thousand dollars in advertising expenditure, sales increase by 1.2 thousand units.
